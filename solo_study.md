### Section 1 – Definitions.

a. __Adapted Material__ means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor.

d. __Copyright and Similar Rights__ means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

e. __Effective Technological Measures__ means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.

f. __Exceptions and Limitations__ means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

j. __Share__ means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.

k. __Sui Generis Database Rights__ means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

l. __You__ means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

### Section 2 – Scope.

a. ___License grant.___

    1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

        A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and

        B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only.

    2. __Exceptions and Limitations.__ For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.

    3. __Term.__ The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

    4. __Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.__ The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.

    5. __Downstream recipients.__

        A. __Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material.__ Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

        B. __Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material.__ Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply.

        C. __No downstream restrictions.__ You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

    6. __No endorsement.__ Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

b. ___Other rights.___

    1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

    2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

    3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial purposes.

### Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.

a. ___Attribution.___

    1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

        A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:

            i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

            ii. a copyright notice;

            iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

            v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;

        B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

        C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.

    2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.

    3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

b. ___ShareAlike.___

In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.

1. The Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.

2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.

3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.

### Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only;

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

### Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. __Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.__

b. __To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.__

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

### Section 6 – Term and Termination.

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:

    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

    2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

### Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.

### Section 8 – Interpretation.

a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.

b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.

c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

# Letters and Words
While we use words without much thought, computers represent
[data](https://glossary.codeunion.io/data) as numbers. In order to store words
in a computer we use a [data type](http://glossary.codeunion.io/data-types)
known as a [string](http://glossary.codeunion.io/string-data-type). Strings are
a [list](http://glossary.codeunion.io/list-data-type) of
[characters](http://glossary.codeunion.io/character-data-type);

## Instructions

This set of exercises is intended to be ran within the `node`
[REPL](http://glossary.codeunion.io/read-evaluate-print-loop-repl)

1. Open a terminal and run `node`
2. Work through each use case and replace `____`s with working code.
3. Confirm the output from the command matches the expected output.

## Exercises
Knowing the length of a string is useful. [Docs for
String.length](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/length)

```javascript
// The > is the REPL prompt. Don't type it!
> 'hi there'.____; // Replace ____ with working code.
8
> 'what's happening?'.____; // Replace ____ with working code.
17
```
Let's swap some words around. [Docs for
String.prototype.replace](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace)

```javascript
// You know the drill.  Replace `____` with appropriate code.
> 'Pretty sure zee is the lamest'.____('lamest', 'coolest');
'Pretty sure zee is the coolest'
> 'Dead men tell no tales'.____('tales', 'rails');
'Dead men tell no rails'
```

Finding a string inside of another string can be useful. [Docs for
String.prototype.match](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match)

```javascript
> 'What kind of madness is this?'.____('madness');
[ 'madness',
    index: 13,
    input: 'What kind of madness is this?' ]
> 'When there is nothing you can find'.____('something');
null

# Introduction to Callbacks
# Events and Callbacks

Working with JavaScript requires understanding how
[events](http://glossary.codeunion.io/event) work. Writing _evented_ JavaScript
requires familiarity with [callback](http://glossary.codeunion.io/callback)
functions.

With events, you write code that says "when this happens, run this function".
For example, a user clicks a button on your web page which makes a modal window
appear.

In both the browser and in node.js, you can write code that _listens for_ and
_responds to_ various events.

There are three components to writing an event listener in JavaScript:

1. The event **target** (in node.js, this is called an _emitter_)
2. The **type** (or name) of the event
3. The **callback** function to run when the event happens (or _fires_)

Here is an example of an event listener in the browser:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <button id="click-me">Press</button>
  </body>

  <script type="text/javascript">
    var button = document.getElementById("click-me");

    button.addEventListener('click', function(evt) {
      alert('You clicked me!');
    });
  </script>
</html>
```

In the code above, the `button` is the event **target** (the button element that
will fire the event), `'click'` is the event **type** (when the button is
clicked, it fires this type of event), and the function

```javascript
function(evt) {
  alert('You clicked me!');
}
```

is the **callback** (the code that runs when the event is triggered).

## Exercises

### Level 1 - Functions that Take Functions as Inputs

* [Introduction to Callbacks](introduction_to_callbacks)
* [setTimeout and setInterval](settimeout_and_setinterval)

In JavaScript, we frequently encounter functions which take other functions as
arguments. This is a powerful technique known as a "callback function". Callback
functions, also referred to as simply "callbacks", are used all over the place
in JavaScript.

Understanding how to use callback functions as well as how to write functions
that accept callback functions as arguments is critical.

These exercises are intended to get a developer comfortable with callbacks in
JavaScript.

## Let's Get Started

1. Open the first JavaScript file as noted by [the suggested
   order](00_SUGGESTED_ORDER.md).
2. Review the use cases at the bottom of the JavaScript file.
3. Uncomment the first use case and make the code work. (Frequently this means
   replacing `____`s with code of your own.)
4. Verify it works. (Run the JavaScript file with `node`.)
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all use cases are working.
6. Repeat steps 1 to 5 until you've worked through all the JavaScript files.
7. Submit a request for feedback on your commits!
# setTimeout and setInterval

Both node.js and the browser implement methods that let us write _timed_ code:
`setInterval` and `setTimeout`.

In other words, we can say things like "wait 5 minutes, then run this code" or
"execute this function every 20 seconds".

The various applications for this kind of code are many. Anytime you have code
whose execution depends on time, you may reach for these methods.

For the most part, these methods will work the same whether you run them in the
browser or in node.js. It is important to recognize that these are different
environments, so you should never expect timers to work _exactly_ the same.

**Documentation references:**

- [Documentation for Window Timers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers)
- [Documentation for Node.js Timers](http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.6.1/api/timers.html)

## Exercises

### Timeouts fire functions after x milliseconds

Can you use `setTimeout` to delay execution of a callback function?

```javascript
console.log("Wait for it...");
__(function() { console.log("NOW!") }, __);
// should print "NOW!" after waiting one second
```

Search suggestion: `delay execution node.js`

### Delayed execution can be weird to understand

Make a hypothesis about what the following code will do. Then run it. Did it do
what you expected? If not, why not?

```javascript
console.log("Before the timeout");
setTimeout(function() { console.log("In the timeout function"); }, 500);
console.log("After the timeout");
```

What about this code?

```javascript
console.log("Before the timeout");
setTimeout(function() { console.log("In the timeout function"); }, 0);
console.log("After the timeout");
```

Search suggestion: `how does setTimeout work javascript`

### Sometimes you want to cancel the timer

Can you write code to prevent the bomb from going off?

```javascript
var bombTimeoutID = setTimeout(function() { console.log("KABOOM!!") }, 7000);
__(__);
```

Search suggestion: `cancel setTimeout function javascript`

### Timers aren't perfect timers

The following code may be confusing. Make a hypothesis about what you think it
will do, then test your hypothesis by running the code. Did it do what you
expected? Why or why not?

```javascript
console.log("Before the timeout");
setTimeout(function() { console.log("In the timeout"); }, 500);
console.log("After the timeout");

var now = Date.now();
console.log("Starting the while loop");
while (Date.now() < now + 3000) {
  // waiting, waiting...
}
console.log("While loop finished");
```

### But they can still be useful

Can you complete the code below to create the desired behavior?

```javascript
var timer = function(seconds, callback) {
  var milliseconds = seconds * 1000;
  console.log("Setting timer for " + seconds + " seconds")
  __(__, __);
};

var breadReminder = function() {
  console.log("Bread is ready!");
}

timer(3, breadReminder)
// should print "Bread is ready!" after a delay of 3 seconds
```

Search suggestion: `syntax setTimeout function javascript`

### An example of a potential use case

Can you complete the code below to configure a session timeout feature (like
what you might find in an online banking account, for example)?

```javascript
var warnTimeout = function() {
  console.log("Your online banking session will end in 5 seconds...");
};

var sessionTimeout = function() {
  console.log("Your online banking session has timed out");
};

var sessionLength = 20 * 1000; // 20 seconds
__(__, sessionLength - 5 * 1000); // 5 seconds before
__(__, sessionLength);
// should print a warning in 15 seconds
// and a session timeout notice in 20 seconds
```

### Intervals do something over and over and over and...

Can you make the following code print `Na-na-na-na` every half second?

```javascript
console.log("Starting the counter");
__(function() {
  console.log("Na-na-na-na");
}, __)
console.log("Counter finished. Maybe?")
// should print "Na-na-na-na" every half second
```

Search suggestion: `call function repeatedly at set times javascript`

### Forever is a long time

So it may be useful to be able to stop your perpetual motion machine after
starting it. Can you figure out how to make a stopwatch that counts the seconds
from 0 but actually **stops** after 5 seconds?

```javascript
var time = 0;
var stopWatch = function() {
  console.log(__);
  time++;
};

console.log("Starting stopwatch");
stopWatch();
var __ = setInterval(stopWatch, 1000);

setTimeout(function() {
  __(__);
}, __);
```

Search suggestion: `stop function in setInterval javascript`

### Working with timer IDs for maximum power

You can have more than one interval going at once, you know. Can you reason
about the following code and see if you can understand what is going on?

```javascript
var timesCounted = 0;
var counter = function() {
  console.log(timesCounted);
  timesCounted++;
};
var counterID = setInterval(counter, 100);

var monitorID;
var monitor = function() {
  if (timesCounted > 20) {
    clearInterval(counterID);
    clearInterval(monitorID);
  }
};
monitorID = setInterval(monitor, 500);
```

### A full-fledged egg timer

Can you put it all together now and complete the implementation for a working
timer that counts down from x seconds to zero?

```javascript
var countDown = function(startTime) {
  console.log(startTime);

  return setInterval(function() {
    __--;
    console.log(__);
  }, __);
};

var setTimer = function(seconds) {
  var milliseconds = __ * __;
  console.log("Setting timer for " + __ + " seconds");

  var counterID = countDown(seconds);

  __(function() {
    console.log("Timer done!");
    clearInterval(__)
  }, __);
};

setTimer(3)
// should set a timer for 3 seconds
// and print each second until it stops
```
